# The classic Minesweeper game written in Vanilla Javascript

This is one of my first projects I made for learning purposes, originally developed in 2017 (I was a beginner back then!).

Although it is a simple minesweeper game, with this you can learn and understand basic concepts of programming and game design!

You can learn about:
* Dynamic HTML elements generation (the game graphics are actually HTML Buttons ðŸ˜€)
* Path-finding algorithms (function for opening tiles with no mines have some similarities!)
* Game mechanics
* Web development
and more!

I thought that maybe this will help someone that is currently a beginner in programming, so this is it!

You can play the game (and score!) or see the code to have a look of how it is made!

If you have some comments or questions feel free to reach me, I would be very glad to discuss with you!
